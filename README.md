# PT Clinic Website

---

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get the website running on your computer.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have these installed on your computer:

- **Node.js** (which includes npm) — download from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)  
  This allows you to run the website locally.

### How to Run the Website Locally

1. **Download or Clone the Project**

   - If you have Git installed, open your command prompt or terminal and run:  
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/carterphoenix/PT-Clinic.git
     ```
   - Or download the ZIP file from the GitHub page and unzip it.

2. **Open the Project Folder**

   Open your command prompt or terminal, then change directory to the project folder. For example:  
   ```bash
   cd PT-Clinic
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Run this command to install everything the website needs to work:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**

   Once dependencies are installed, run:  
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the website locally, and you can view it in your web browser.

5. **Open the Website**

   Your browser should automatically open the site at:  
   [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)  

   If it doesn’t, open your browser and type that address.
